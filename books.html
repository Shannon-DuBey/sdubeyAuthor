								<span class="dropcap">A</span> small town filled with prying eyes. A high school that tolerates bullying and violence. 
								Parents who cannot handle news of their child being different. 
								These are the three most volatile components of any teen struggling to find their way and when that child is a young lesbian 
								struggling with her identity and how to keep it a secret, the mixture brews more trouble than most can imagine.
								<br /><br />
								Growing up different is hard enough, but with the pressures of life in a small town, it can be down right impossible. 
								For Shane, surviving her junior high and high school years was made possible because she stumbled upon a friend in the 
								most unlikely of places, a teacher!

							<h2>Reader Comments:</h3>
							<p>
								<h3>Excellent Choice!</h3>
								<br />
								<h4>L. E. Pelletier</h4>
								<p>
									The struggle of this character was heart-wrenching. 
									I was brought to tears several times during this book. 
									Many times I felt like I wanted to jump into the book to help out, or give a hug, or listen. 
									... it really puts into perspective just how difficult it can be for someone to be open about who they are 
									... Read this book!
								</p>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3>Amazing, insperational, a must read!</h3>
								<br />
								<h4>Shawn C.</h4>
								<p>
									I received my copy of this book yesterday afternoon and could not put it down! 
									It is a must read for all!
									... it has been so well written that everyone can relate to it!
								</p>
							</p>
							<p>
								<h3>Great Perception!</h3>
								<h4>S. Scarbrough</h4>
								<p>
									Having a child go through the same experiences in a small town school system, 
									Shannon gave great perception and painted a perfect picture for the reader of what 
									it is like living it from "the other side of the mirror".

								<span class="dropcap">E</span>ven snowboards need playmates!. Timmy, a snowboard designed just for use by the smallest of snowboarders, 
								longs for a rider of his own. He wants someone to play with in the snow all winter long, and a Little Rider who will apreciate his ability to fly over the snow. 
								<br /><br />
								After years of collecting dust in a local snowboard shop, Timmy's dream finally comes true. Join Timmy on his adventure as he meets the perfect Little Rider 
								for his small features, watches sadly as he walks out of the snowboard shop without him, and one day finds himself standing in the corner of the little boys room. 
								From the surprise present to the final adventure in the snow with his Little Rider, join Timmy on a fantastic journey into the life cycle of a snowboard.
