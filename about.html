					<h2>About The Author</h2>
					<div id="about-content">
						<p>
							<span class="dropcap">S</span>hannon DuBey is a professional computer geek by day, and a published author by night. 
							The first printing of <span class="italic"><a href="books.html#unconditional">Unconditional</a></span> was in 2007 and she has since published a children's story 
							titled <span class="italic"><a href="books.html#timmy">Timmy Meets His Match</a></span> and begun work on both a new novel and another children's story.
							<br /><br />
							While her life began in a rural community in the northern portion of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, 
							the portion that looks like a giant mitten on the map, she currently resides in the area known by locals as "Metro Detroit". 
							This move was made almost immediately after graduating from high school in the mid 1990's with the intent to obtain a bachelor 
							degree in psychology and become a teen crisis counselor. Because college life tends to create bills rather than pay them, she accepted a 
							full time position working on a computer help desk for a local company. she quickly discovered that while her passion lie with helping others, 
							the technology field would pay the bills and allow her to help others in a different way. 
							<br /><br />
							Now some 15 years later, Shannon is still a self-professed "Professional Computer Geek" by day and spends what free time she can manage to find 
							pursuing her artistic side. This comes most often in the form of writing and has resulted in two completed works to date with plenty more not far off.
